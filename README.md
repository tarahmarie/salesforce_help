flows for Salesforce help: minuscule improvements on Salesforce task flows like MFA

After a horrifying day trying to figure out how to simply enable MFA for my company's users on Salesforce.com, I have edited down into the tiniest and shortest flow possible the instructions for getting this working for you. I've synthesized the instruction video here that the (I'm sure lovely) Salesforce social media person tweeted at me, fixed the inaccuracies in that video, and reduced down all the instructions I found online to these ten steps. If you can see a way to improve on this, please, submit a PR or let me know tarah@redqueentech.com or @tarah on Twitter. Hug (figuratively and in a socially distanced manner) a user today, and build better and simpler security tools! Original tweet thread here: https://twitter.com/tarah/status/1430973286242938881
